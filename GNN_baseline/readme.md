The Gwaveï¼ŒSTGCN and STSGCN baslines in our paper. We modify the outputs of STGCN and Gwave, making them capable of producing multiple variables.

The original STGCN project can be found in [STGCN-PyTorch](https://github.com/FelixOpolka/STGCN-PyTorch)

The original STSGCN project can be found in [STSGCN](https://github.com/FraLuca/STSGCN)

We also include two variants of STPN. The STPN-TCN uses TCN instead of self-attention for modeling temporal dependencies. The STPN-RNN uses LSTM with graph convolutional gates.
